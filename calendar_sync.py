"""Every meeting on his calendar, kept where the page can draw it.

The week strip used to know two rooms, the standup and the weekly, because
those were the ones `sessions` on the board carried. Everything else he walked
into (the X-Workstream meeting, the TG-KT討議会, a huddle) he found by opening
Google Calendar, and its notes by opening the event again afterwards. So the
desk was a one-stop shop for the work and not for the day.

This reads the calendar and writes `state/calendar.json`, which the page draws
from beside the board. It is not on the board on purpose: a meeting is a fact
about his week, not a job, and a sweep rewriting tickets has no business
touching it. Nothing here ever writes to the calendar; the run that reads it is
handed exactly one tool, the search.

The read goes through a headless Claude run because the Google connection is an
MCP server behind the hub and there is no other way in. It is the cheapest run
this repo makes: Haiku, one tool, no project instructions, about 8 cents. The
tool's answer is too long for the model to read and is saved to a file, which is
the point: this reads that file directly, so the events arrive exactly as Google
sent them and the model is never asked to repeat 190KB of JSON.

    ./calendar_sync.py            fetch now, print what it found
    ./calendar_sync.py --show     print what is stored, fetch nothing
