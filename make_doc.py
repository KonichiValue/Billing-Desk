"""Turn a document in `docs/` into the PDF that gets handed to Tokyo Gas.

Some work leaves this desk as a document rather than as a message: a handover
sheet, a procedure, anything TG keep open on a second screen while they do the
thing. Those live in `docs/` as HTML, because HTML is what this repo can write
and diff, and they go out as PDF, because that is what gets attached to a
ticket and read on a phone.

Chrome does the printing. Standard-library PDF writing cannot embed a Japanese
font, so a hand-rolled PDF comes out as boxes, and every third-party library
that solves that is a dependency this repo does not take.

    python3 make_doc.py                  every document in docs/
