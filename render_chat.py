"""The side panel: one long conversation, beside the page rather than on it.

A card's ask box is right for a question about that card, and wrong for the
half hour of back and forth he kept taking to a chat window instead: on a card
every exchange folds, the composer shuts after each send, and the conversation
is somewhere down a long page. The panel is the same record, so a question asked
here is on the card too, drawn the way a chat is drawn: everything open, oldest
at the top, the composer always there, and each new question a follow-up to the
last answer unless he starts a new topic.

It follows whichever conversation he picked last, the desk as a whole by
default, and any card's composer can send him here with what he had typed.

What it is about is said twice, because a dropdown reading "Job 50: Reply to
Tanaka-san" was not enough to know which ticket the answer was working on: the
picker names the ticket, and a strip under the header carries the job's number,
its ticket, where it stands and a link to its card.
