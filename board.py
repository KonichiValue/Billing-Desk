"""The board: every open TG billing ticket, and every item of work on it.

This is the one durable file. Days come and go, the standup happens or does
not, but a ticket stays open until Asana says otherwise and an item keeps its
number until it is closed. That is the difference between a record of a meeting
and a to-do list you can actually work from.

Shape of `state/board.json`:

    {
      "version": 1,
      "checked_at": "2026-08-24T18:20:00+09:00",

                  "internal_ticket": {"name", "url", "build": {...}},
                  "terms": [{"term", "say", "means", "source_url"}],
                  "events": [{"on": "2026-08-24", "at": "15:14", "who", "what",
                              "so_what", "where", "source_url"}],
                  "prep": { ...see below... },
                  "items": [ ...see below... ]
                }
              ]
            }

`sessions` is every room Rei still has to speak in, soonest first. A list,
because an onsite on Wednesday and a standup on Monday are two different
rooms, and `script.for_date` says which one the current script was written for.
A standup that is not running stays in the list with `skipped` set, since "no
standup Wednesday" changes what has to move into Asana instead.

    [{"kind": "standup|weekly|onsite|workshop", "date": "2026-08-26", "at": "10:30",
      "label", "title", "place", "focus", "skipped", "reason", "quote",
      "timetable": [{"at": "11:00", "what": "...", "mine": true}],
      "agenda": [{"topic", "why", "owner"}], "bring": ["..."]}]

`timetable` is for a session that is a day rather than a slot. An onsite has a
building to be at, a standup somewhere in the middle of it and an hour when the
real discussion starts, and none of those is the time on the invite. `mine` on a
row is the part that concerns him, and those are the rows the page emphasises.
Leave it out for an ordinary standup, where `at` is the whole story.

`xws` is the Friday X-Workstream rollup, and it is deliberately not one of the
`sessions`. The standup is a room he walks ticket by ticket; the X-Workstream is
the whole programme in one room, where only the biggest billing items are ever
taken up from him. So it does not drive the full speaking walk (that stays the
soonest real `session`), it renders as one folded card at the top of the speaking
view, shown or hidden with a button, holding a shortlist of the items big enough
to surface. Keeping it out of `sessions` is what lets both be prepared at once:
the standup as the full walk, the rollup as the exception list on top of it.

    {"for_date": "2026-09-11", "at": "11:00", "built_at": "ISO+09:00",
     "headline": "what he raises at the rollup, or that nothing is big enough",
     "raised": [{"ref": "外部キー違反",
                 "why": "why this one is big enough for the whole workstream",
                 "say": [{"ja_ruby": "{漢字|かんじ}…", "en": "…"}]}]}

An empty `raised` is a fact worth walking in with, so the card still draws on its
`headline` alone: "nothing from billing needs the room this week" is a thing to
know, not a blank.

`huddle` is the TG Team Huddle rollup (Wednesday 11:30), a short Kraken-internal
update in English, and like `xws` it is not one of the `sessions`. It renders as
its own folded card on the speaking view and is only rewritten on a Wednesday.

    {"for_date": "2026-09-16", "at": "11:30", "built_at": "ISO+09:00",
     "plate": ["one terse line per thing on his plate now"],
     "blockers": ["only a genuine blocker; usually one line or none"]}

Both `plate` and `blockers` are plain strings, English, no furigana. Keep it to
the short bullet shape Rei writes in Notion, and be selective: "No blockers" is
the common, honest answer.

`news` is what is moving around Rei that is not one of his tickets: a priority
that changed, an outage upstream, a decision on somebody else's ticket that
lands on his. The desk answers "what do I do" perfectly well without it, and
answers "what has changed around me" not at all, which is the thing you walk
into a room not knowing. Five rows at most, dropped as they go stale.

    [{"topic", "what", "why", "on": "2026-08-24", "source_url"}]

Questions asked from the page do not live here. They sit in `state/asks.json`,
keyed by what they were asked about, because an agent rewriting the board should
never be able to lose the reason a draft says what it says:

    {"asks": [{"id", "ref": "item:8" or "ticket:託送HOLD", "question",
               "asked_at": "2026-08-25 16:36", "answer",
               "state": "running|answered|failed"}]}

`prompt-ask.md` is what answers one, and an answer may change the item it was
asked about. Item state is not part of that: `tick.py` is the only thing that
moves an item, however plainly the question says the work is done.

`meeting_note` and `migration_note` record which standup notes were last folded
in, so a refresh does not re-read them. Same shape: `date`, `found`, `url`.
Billing standup goes in `meeting_note`; Migration daily (Mon-Thu) and Friday
X-Workstream billing mentions go in `migration_note`.

`other_notes` is the same record for a room that is neither: a one-off session
whose note was read once because something in it reached a ticket. Same shape
plus `title` and `gist`, so a later refresh knows it has already been read and
what came out of it.

    [{"date", "title", "url", "found", "gist"}]

`news` is drawn in the brief at the top of the work view: the newest row as the
Big news line, the rest folded under it. The next session and `alert` are lines
of the same brief, so the morning is one block rather than a brief and a second
fold repeating it.

`alert` is the exception, and it is empty almost every day: something that needs
him inside the hour and is not an item, because there is nothing to do until
somebody else moves. Two sentences that make sense to someone who has read
nothing else, and a link to the message.

    {"what": "...", "source_url": "..."}

`brief` is the morning briefing: the five things he would want a secretary to
tell him before the day starts, and nothing else.

    {"built_at": "2026-09-28T08:15:00+09:00", "for_date": "2026-09-28",
     "lines": [{"what": "...", "kind": "room|moved|do|watch|big",
                "items": ["43"], "ref": "保安閉栓",
                "source_url": "...", "at": "10:30"}]}

**Five lines, hard cap, and fewer is the normal answer.** Everything on the board
is already on a card; this is only the part that is true *this morning* and would
cost him something to miss. A sixth line means one of the five was not important
enough, not that today was busy.

`kind` is what sort of thing it is, and orders the list:

- `room` a session today and what he owes it. Always first if there is one.
- `moved` something that changed since the last brief: a reply landed, TG closed
  a ticket, a flag went on, a ticket was assigned to him.
- `do` what to start on, named by item number so he can act on it at once.
- `watch` something with a clock on it he cannot act on: a hold window, someone
  away, a release going out.
- `big` the exception to "his work only". Something happening across TG **or
  Kyuden** with enough people and enough consequence that not knowing it would
  be worse than any of the above: a platform decision, a migration-wide freeze,
  an incident that will reach billing. It does not need a route to one of his
  tickets, which is the one place on this board that rule is relaxed. Most days
  there is none, and inventing one to fill the slot is the failure mode.

`items` are item numbers the line is about, so the page can link them. `ref` is a
ticket tag when the line is about one. A line with neither is fine for `big`.

Written by the sweep as its last step, and rewritten every time, so it always
matches the board it was drawn from. The page says its age and refuses to draw a
brief written for a day that has passed, because a stale briefing read as a
current one is worse than no briefing.

`terms` carries the vocabulary of the ticket in both languages: `term` in
English, `say` as TG say it with furigana as `{漢字|かんじ}`, `means` in a
sentence or two that opens with what the thing is. He hears the Japanese in the
room and has two seconds to place it, so the Japanese is not optional.

`glossary` is the short version of the same thing, board-wide, and the renderers
use it rather than the page. A flat map of the Japanese term to two or three
words of English:

    {"閉栓翌日開栓": "open the day after close", "検針日": "meter reading date"}

Every English line on the page gets the meaning put after the first Japanese term
it contains, once per card and once again in the script, since the script is all
that is left in Japanese-only mode. So write the English plainly and leave the
gloss out of it: writing it by hand is how a term ends up explained twice in one
sentence. A term that is not in here is a term he reads without knowing, so add
it when it first appears in something written for him.

`prep` is what the ticket sounds like out loud, and only the speaking view reads
it. It is rebuilt whenever Rei presses Write prep, and it deliberately holds no
status of its own: that view takes `where_it_stands` from the ticket, so a script
can never contradict the desk.

    {"order": 1, "board_position": "3 of 14 on the board",
     "issue": ["plain English, two or three lines"], "why_it_matters",
     "consequences": {"fix_covers", "falls_outside", "accumulates",
                      "who_owns_it", "done_means", "still_open"},
     "open_questions": [{"en", "ja_ruby", "who"}],
     "script": [{"heading": "現状", "heading_en": "Where it stands",
                 "lines": [{"ja_ruby": "{託送|たくそう}...", "en": "..."}]}],
     "decisions": [{"need", "why", "fallback"}],      onsite only
     "pushback": [{"they_say", "say_ja", "say_en"}],   onsite only
     "tg_ask_needed": true, "estimate": "", "unknowns": [], "built_at"}

`decisions` and `pushback` are what an onsite needs and a 15 minute standup does
not: what has to be settled before everyone leaves the room, and the sentence
ready for the objection that stops it being settled.

An item with `at_standup` true is work that has to be spoken about rather than
only done, so it shows on both views: on the desk with a "raise at" pill naming
the session, in the script under the ticket it belongs to.

An item is a piece of work with a life:

            {"id": 3, "title", "prepared", "steps": [], "done_when", "why",
             "state": "todo|waiting|hold|done|sent|dropped",
             "state_at", "state_note", "waits_on", "hold", "draft",
             "where", "link", "urgency", "est_minutes", "opened", "closed_at",
             "after": 17,
             "at_standup", "at_standup_note",
             "history": [{"at", "state", "note"}]}

`after` is the item number this one queues behind, and it is the difference
between a list of five things and one thing to do. Most work on a ticket is a
sequence: the scope cannot be confirmed before the sheet exists, and the sheet
cannot go out before the questions on it are settled. Listing all three as jobs
invents two decisions Rei does not have, and the page stops telling him where to
start. So only the front of a queue is a job. The rest stay on the ticket, folded,
saying which number they follow, and each becomes a job by itself the moment the
one in front of it closes.

Use it only for a real dependency, where doing this one first would be wrong or
impossible. Two jobs that merely happen to be on the same ticket are two jobs.
Two jobs that end in the same message are not two jobs at all: fold them into one
item rather than chaining them, because he sends one message. An `after` pointing
at a closed item is spent and ignored, so nothing has to clean it up.

`steps` is what he actually does, in order, verb first, and it is the one field
an item cannot be useful without. `done_when` is the finished thing in a line,
so he can tell whether he is there. `why` is last on the card and shortest: he
does not need persuading about his own list, he needs to know what to type.

`draft` is the whole of the doing when the step is "send this", so a step that
tells him to ask, tell, confirm or reply and carries no draft is a bug.

    {"language": "ja",                     "ja" or "en", and it picks where the body is read from
     "target": "who and where it goes",    the head of the box, e.g. "Asana comment on 保安閉栓, reply to Tamanoi"
     "link": "https://...",                optional, the Go there button
     "body_ruby": "{漢字|かんじ}で…",        a ja draft's text, with furigana on whole words
     "body_en": "…",                       an en draft's text; or the translation shown under a ja draft
     "reply_from": "Tanaka-san",           optional, who answers it, when that is not the addressee
     "expects_reply": false,               optional, only when nothing comes back from it
     "sent": false}                        set true by the Sent button (or tick.py --draft)

A job that sends more than one message (a reply to TG and one to the engineer
who answered) puts the first in `draft` and the rest in `drafts`, a list of the
same shape. Each shows as its own box above `prepared`, never as a note inside it.

Every unsent draft carries a Sent bar on the page. Pressing it marks that draft
`sent`, and once the last draft on the job has gone it moves the job: waiting on
everyone a draft expects a reply from, or closed as `sent` when none does. So
`reply_from` and `expects_reply` are how a writer says what happens after the
message, and a step never says it. **Never write a `./tick.py` command, or any
other instruction for moving the job, into `steps`**: he would need a terminal
for a thing the card does in one press, and audit.py flags it.

The body has to be under the key the renderer reads, or the card shows an empty
box that reads as ready to paste: a ja draft in `body_ruby` (furigana on whole
words, never katakana), an en draft in `body_en`. `body_ja` and a bare `body`
still render as a fallback but carry no furigana, so they are wrong for anything
going to TG. board.check() refuses a draft with no readable body at all.

`prepared` is the part an agent could do and therefore did. If the steps could
be followed by something without judgement, following them was the agent's job,
and what is left for Rei is checking it, deciding with it or saying it out loud.

    {"what": "one line naming the thing that now exists",
     "conclusion": "one or two plain sentences: what is true, then what it means",
     "built_at": "2026-08-25 11:20",
     "table": {"columns": [], "rows": [[...]]},   optional
     "findings": ["one fact each, so-what first, four at most"],
     "notes": [{"heading": "what kind of information this is", "body": "..."}],
     "unanswered": ["what the work could not settle"],
     "files": [{"label": "Handover sheet, Japanese, PDF",
                "path": "docs/handover-forced-issue-billing.pdf"},
               {"label": "Phase 2 visualisation, Miro",
                "url": "https://miro.com/app/board/..."}],
     "meeting_use": {"label": "Open onsite version",
                     "summary": "what was moved into the script"},
     "sources": [{"label", "url"}]}

All of it is written to be read once. One idea to a sentence, the plain word
over the dense one, numbers and file:line rather than adjectives, and the bottom
line first so he can act on it without reading further. prompt-post.md, "Write
it so he reads it once", carries the standard, and it holds for every card the
app writes. It changes how the work reads, never what is in it: `unanswered`
stays whole and every source stays cited.

The table contains only like-for-like evidence. A stakeholder's desired
outcome, an implementation constraint and a query condition are different kinds
of information, so label them in `notes` rather than dropping them into one
comparison row. A cell written as `{"text": "The one gap", "tone":
"good|gap|warn"}` prints as a verdict instead of prose, so the row that is the
point of the table is findable without reading every cell. One verdict column,
and the reasoning stays in `findings`.

`unanswered` is what the work could not settle, and it is not optional
politeness. Prepared work that hides its own gaps reads as a finished answer,
and he carries it into a room on that basis. Name the thing, and name why it is
open: nobody has been asked, or the answer given was not usable.

`files` is for work that leaves the desk as a document rather than as a message:
a handover sheet, a procedure TG keep open while they work. The document lives
in `docs/` as HTML and goes out as the PDF beside it, built by `make_doc.py`.
The page serves `docs/` at `/doc/`, so the button opens the real file rather
than a copy pasted into the board. Never furigana in one of these: `draft` text
is for Rei reading aloud, a document is for the reader who receives it.

An entry may carry a `url` rather than a `path` when the thing the work produced
cannot live in the repo, a Miro board being the case that forced it. Use it only
for something the work made. Something it merely read is a `sources` row, and
somewhere a conversation is happening is a `threads` row on the ticket.

`meeting_use` links the work product to the same ticket on the What I say view;
the meeting-ready words live in `prep`, not twice on the item.

`closes_when` is every gate between here and a closed ticket, in the order it
has to fall, including the ones that are nobody's item: an engineer being
assigned, a release landing, TG checking the bills that came out after it.
Without it a ticket with no open items reads as finished when it is only quiet.
`state` is `done`, `now` (his), `blocked` or `next` (somebody else's), and `who`
names them. Point `note` at the item number when an item is already tracking the
gate, rather than restating it.

    [{"what": "An engineer assigned to the build", "who": "Kraken CE",
      "state": "next", "note": "The one thing this ticket is waiting on."}]

`no_ticket_yet` is for work he is carrying that Asana has never heard of: agreed
in a Slack thread, real enough to prepare for, and with no gid to hang it on.
The ticket takes a slug for its `id`, leaves `asana` and `asana_url` empty, and
this field says why there is no ticket and what would raise one. The card says
"work in hand" rather than "Asana ticket", so nobody goes looking for a link
that does not exist. Fill it in the moment a ticket is raised and delete it.

`internal_ticket` links the Kraken-side CE build when TG is waiting on code.
`name` and `url` open it. `build` is what the desk prints under Where it stands,
because "queued behind an engineer" is half of where a TG ticket is:

    {"kt": "KT-92085",
     "stage": "refining|queued|building|review|released|verified",
     "asana_status": "Asana's own words for it",
     "engineer": "",                    empty means nobody has picked it up
     "size": "2 SP", "refined_by": "Rie Nakayama", "refinement": "🟢",
     "feature_flag": "Yes|No",          Yes means release and switch-on differ
     "moved_on": "2026-08-24",          Asana modified_at, date only
     "waiting_on": "the one sentence saying why it is not moving",
     "safe_to_say": "the line to TG that carries none of the above"}

`stage` runs one stop past the release because a TG ticket closes when TG have
checked the bills, not when the code lands. All of it is desk only, and
`safe_to_say` is the only part that may be repeated to TG. Never in `prep`.
`none_yet` replaces `build` when no build has been raised, and says why, since
an empty queue is a fact about the ticket too.

An item with a `prepared` block has steps that start after it: read this, take
it into the room, send it. Never steps that redo it.

Only `tick.py` and the agents write here. Renderers read it and never change it.

**Every write goes through `save()`, and `save()` is safe to call from anywhere
at once.** A refresh, two asks and a `./tick.py` in a terminal can all hold the
board in memory at the same time. Each `load()` remembers the file it read, and
`save()` takes `state/board.lock`, reads the file again, and if somebody else
wrote it in between, merges: their change and this one both land, field by
field, and only a field both of them changed is decided by this writer. Items
are matched by number and tickets by gid, so a sweep adding an event never
erases the draft an ask rewrote a minute earlier. Never edit `board.json` with
a text editor or a string replace: that skips the lock, the merge and the check.

`save()` also keeps what a writer throws away. A `prepared` finding or note that
a rewrite drops moves into `prepared.earlier` with the time it went, so a sweep
condensing twelve findings into four costs nothing he can not get back, and an
item may never vanish from a ticket that is still on the board. Close it as
`dropped` instead, because the number is how he refers to it.

    "earlier": [{"at": "ISO", "text": "a finding or 'Heading: body'"}]

`milestones` is work Rei leads that is bigger than one ticket: an Asana
milestone, a Jira epic, a row on the Notion TG page with his name as Lead. It
is assigned to him there, which is what earns it a place, and it holds no work
of its own. The work is the tickets and items it points at, so the epic and its
children can never disagree about what is open.

    [{"id": "elec-price-update",            a slug, so apply.py can address it
      "name": "Elec Price Update", "name_ja": "電気料金改定",
      "target": "2026-11-30",              ISO, the date it has to be done by
      "target_note": "desired due date",
      "status": "on-track|at-risk|off-track|done",
      "outcome", "lead", "support", "notes", "source_url", "asana_url",
      "phases": [{"what", "when", "state": "done|now|next|blocked",
                  "who", "note", "items": [52]}],
      "tickets": [{"ref", "title", "asana_url", "assignee", "state"}],
      "items": [52, 54]}]

`prioritization` is every CE build whose CDL-Owner is Rei, as Asana had it when
a sweep last read them, for Heqing's bi-weekly prioritization round. The round
dates are not here: `prioritize.py` works them out from `config.json`. CDL-Owner
is the whole membership rule, so a build owned by another CDL never appears,
however close it sits to one of his tickets.

    {"checked_at": "ISO",
     "last_round": {"date": "2026-10-13", "url": "the Slack thread",
                    "ordered": ["KT-108568", "KT-108653"],
                    "not_pushed": ["KT-106562"]},   his builds only
     "builds": [{"kt": "KT-107146", "gid", "url", "name",
                 "ticket": "供給中断取込",          board ref, or "" when none
                 "status": "Status (Kraken Cust)", "refinement": "🟢",
                 "size": "3 SP", "tg_order": "", "wave": "", "squad": "",
                 "due_on": "YYYY-MM-DD or empty", "engineer": "",
                 "why": "one line for Heqing on why it should be ordered"}]}

A build with no TG Order that is refined is one to raise; `why` is the reason
in Heqing's words, written for a Kraken reader. Like `internal_ticket.build`,
none of it ever reaches TG.

`phases` is the path to done, in order, the way `closes_when` is for a ticket.
`tickets` lists every ticket under it, his or not: a `ref` that is on the board
links to that card, anything else is a child he follows and does not own, and
it stays a row here rather than becoming a card. `items` are item numbers on
any ticket that move the milestone; the page counts them for its progress bar.
