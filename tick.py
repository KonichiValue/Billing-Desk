"""Move an item along, then rebuild the desk.

An item has one of three lives: it is with you, it is with somebody else, or it
is finished. Sending a message usually moves it to the middle one, and it comes
back to you on the same number when they reply.

    ./tick.py                            where everything is
    ./tick.py --rebuild                  redraw both pages, change nothing
    ./tick.py 4                          finished, nothing comes back
    ./tick.py 2 -w "Kevin"               sent, ball is with Kevin, chase in 2 working days
    ./tick.py 2 -w "Kevin" -n "asked about the account-level hold"
    ./tick.py 2 --mine                   they replied, it is yours again
    ./tick.py 5 --dropped -n "TG answered it themselves"
    ./tick.py 1 --undo                   back to with you, forget the note
    ./tick.py 52 --draft 1               posted draft 1; the job moves once its last draft has gone

The page does the last one from the Posted it button on each draft, so nobody
should need a terminal for it: it waits on whoever the drafts expect a reply
from, or closes as sent when nothing comes back. -w overrides who, and --sent
with it says nothing comes back.

Numbers live on the board and are never reused, so "do 4" means the same thing
next week. State lives in `state/board.json` beside the item it describes.
