"""Keep a copy of the board before anything writes it.

`state/board.json` is the only durable file here and it is not in git, so a
sweep that decides a ticket no longer belongs to Rei can take a week of numbered
work with it and leave nothing to read back. That happened on 27 August: a
reassignment in Asana dropped a whole ticket, and the only way back was the
rendered pages and the fold scripts in /tmp.

So every agent run takes a copy first. Small file, stdlib only, forty deep,
which is a fortnight of runs at three a day.
