"""The week ahead: the rooms he speaks in, and everything that comes due.

Split out of `render_desk.py`, which had grown to 2300 lines and held eight
unrelated jobs. This one answers a single question, "is the week covered", and
it is the only file that knows how a day is drawn.

The first version of this was a strip of seven boxes with a job number in each,
which looked like a calendar and was useless as one: a 10.5px chip reading `13
強制発行` tells you a number is due without telling you what it is, whose it is
or whether it is late. A calendar you cannot read at a glance is decoration.

So a day here is a column of real rows. Each row carries the job number, what
the job actually is, and who is holding it, coloured the way the rest of the
page colours work: red is his, amber is stuck, blue is with someone else. Today
is wider than the rest, because today is the column he reads.
